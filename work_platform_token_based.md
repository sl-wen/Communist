# Online Work Platform (Token-based Compensation)

## Concept
This platform facilitates collaborative work on larger projects, with compensation primarily handled through a dedicated platform token. It aims to foster a community-driven approach to project development and execution.

## Potential Features
- Project posting and discovery.
- Team formation tools.
- Task management and progress tracking.
- Version control integration (e.g., Git).
- Smart contracts for managing token-based payments upon task completion.
- Dispute resolution mechanisms.
- Governance model for platform development and project funding (potentially involving community voting).
- Integration with the Skills Assessment Platform for team member validation.

## Next Steps
- Define the scope and types of projects to be supported.
- Research existing decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and collaborative platforms.
- Detail the tokenomics for the compensation system.
- Outline the technical infrastructure for smart contracts and project management.
